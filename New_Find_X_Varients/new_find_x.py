#can be structured by doing the opposite of pemdas to the most normal side (answer side)
#in standard solving for x format. It'll just be a sequence of doing the opposite of 
#pemdas on that normal side. For example: (4x + 3 = 15) 1. subtract 3 from 15 2. divide 4
#from the right side

#calculate steps:
#1. create the side without x, called "norm"
#2. simplify
#3. subtract or add things to help isolate the variable / x
#4. use multiplication or division to solve for the variable 

#notes:
#you can only peform distrubutive property after simplifying
